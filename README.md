I got kicked from the project GitHub/slack/discord without salary)
So the version here is without 2 last weeks of bug-solving and connecting the network layer to the UI.
However, it's unneeded anyway since I doubt anyone who will check this code has HVAC conditioner to test it

I feel bad leaving it here so undone with so many bugs but believe me, they were solved, I swear ðŸ¥º
The network layer was tested too, I had a real conditioner to test!ðŸ˜Ž

Note: the whole thing was done in 2 months having initially **absolutely** no with SwiftUI, very little with URL requests, no working app reference, PM not understanding what he wanted, and a screwed up Figma design that was done half a year prior to me developing an app by the designer with 0 ideas of whats going on in an app and who has left the company

it may seem ok at first but trust me its very bad
